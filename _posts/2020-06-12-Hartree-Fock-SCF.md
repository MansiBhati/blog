title: Hartree-Fock SCF
---
<div style="text-align: justify"> I believe the best way to understand the Hartree-Fock Self-Consistent Field Procedure is by actually applying it to a system. Therefore, I have taken an example of the simplest closed-shell heteronuclear molecule, the H—He+ molecule, and solved for its energies using the STO-1G basis set. Here, I have written python code to approach this problem. </div>

The bond length is taken to be 0.800 Å i.e. 1.5117 a.u. (bohr). Here I will use the simplest Gaussian basis set, i.e. 1s atomic orbital on each of the atoms is approximated by one s type Gaussian function. An s-type Gaussian function: 
$$\phi=a.\exp(-br^2)$$
