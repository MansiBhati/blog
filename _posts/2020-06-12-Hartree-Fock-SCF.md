title: Hartree-Fock SCF
---
<center>I believe the best way to understand the Hartree-Fock Self-Consistent Field Procedure is by actually applying it to a system. Therefore, I have taken an example of the simplest closed-shell heteronuclear molecule, the Hâ€”He+ molecule, and solved for its energies using the STO-1G basis set. Here, I have written python code to approach this problem.</center>
